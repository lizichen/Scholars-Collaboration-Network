#Key Research Questions:

##How do NSF programs vary in the extent to which they
1. foster new collaborations


2. strengthen existing collaborations


3. foster/strengthen different kinds of collaborations


     i.e. cross-disciplinary collaborations; this may not be an appropriate question for all programs,
     but will be for many sustainability science programs, and other programs that specifically seek
     to encourage collaboration across traditional disciplinary boundaries as a way of tackling “wicked”
     environmental problems...

##Which programs foster successful collaborations as measured by
1. more publications,
2. more joint authorship,
3. higher-ranked publications, and
4. more highly cited publications.

##Which programs foster the production of manuscripts that have broad implications within/beyond their field (as analyzed through network analysis and number and origin of citations)?


Is there a way to see which papers connect to other clusters of authors/papers more effectively?

##Across programs, how do factors such as
1. award size,
2. geographic distribution of co-awardees,
3. number of awardees, etc., affect collaboration success and network impacts?;

  cross-disciplinarity might also be thought of as a factor that potentially influences success
