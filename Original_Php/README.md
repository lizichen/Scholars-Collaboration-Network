Note: These php files were originally used by previous programmers on this project. Due to the speed limitation and large amount of data process, we decided to stop using such portal. Instead, we now just run scripts when we need data. All the scrapping and filtering work will be done first on a cluster of AWS EC2 machines, then the collected data will be stored and used for relation mapping and identification.
